            'The Crown of the British Empire was made in 1838 for Queen Victoria, and was then altered twice: in 1937 for the coronation of George VI and in 1953 for Elizabeth II. The crown became lighter and more comfortable, but the number of precious stones remained unchanged.',
            'It contains over 3,000 diamonds, 277 pearls, as well as sapphires, emeralds, and rubies, among which are several stones of historical significance. For example, on the front cross is the Black Prince`s ruby, and below on the front is the Cullinan II diamond.',
            'In this crown, Elizabeth II (1926-2022) opened parliamentary sessions annually, and now her son, Charles III, does so.'

            'The silver-gilt crown was made in 1775 for Charles III. The Spanish Association of Jewellers and Appraisers believes that it is formally worth no more than 6,000 euros. ',
            'However, considering the historical significance of the object, the price could easily exceed 100,000 euros. The last time the regalia was presented to the public was on June 19, 2014, during the oath-taking of King Felipe VI. However, it was not placed on the monarch`s head but rested on a cushion alongside the sceptre.'
